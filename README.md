# Advanced Programming Topics Projects
These are the most notable projects from my junior year computer science class: Advanced Programming Topics. 

## Tic Tac Toe 
This project, written in Java, is a Tic Tac Toe game with a functional AI bot (implemented with the minimax algorithm) and variable sizes. 

## Path finding 
This project, also written in Java, implements the A* and Dijkstra pathfinding algorithms. It allows the user to both generate a random maze or input their own custom maze in a file to path find through.

## Zip Compressor 
This project, written in C, is a Zip compressor that uses DEFLATE compression and can compress both directories and files. It uses dynamic Huffman codes instead of fixed Huffman codes.
